## **[react-native-vision-camera](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera)**

VisionCamera is the go-to component when creating React Native apps that require the functionality of using the device's camera. Maintained by the React Native community, this module has support for: Videos. Photographs. Face Detection and etc.

## **[vision-camera-image-labeler](https://github.com/mrousavy/vision-camera-image-labeler)**

A [VisionCamera](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera) Frame Processor Plugin to label images using [**MLKit Vision** Image Labeling](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/image-labeling). Its main purpose is the auxiliary library that allows it to define what objects it sees from the camera.

## **[**vision-camera-ocr**](https://github.com/aarongrider/vision-camera-ocr)**

A [VisionCamera](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera) Frame Processor Plugin to preform text detection on images using [**MLKit Vision** Text Recognition](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition).

## Examples

```bash

The Text Recognizer segments text into blocks, lines, and elements. Roughly speaking:

a Block is a contiguous set of text lines, such as a paragraph or column,

a Line is a contiguous set of words on the same axis, and

an Element is a contiguous set of alphanumeric characters ("word") on the same axis in most Latin languages, or a character in others
